#### Scenario 2: Market Research for New Store Locations

- A liquor store owner in Iowa is looking to expand to new locations and has hired you to investigate the market data for potential new locations. The business owner is interested in the details of the best model you can fit to the data so that his team can evaluate potential locations for a new storefront.

Goal for Scenario #2: Your task is to:

- Build models of total sales based on location, price per bottle, total bottles sold. You may find it useful to build models for each county, zip code, or city.
- Provide a table of the best performing stores by location type of your choice (city, county, or zip code) and the predictions of your model(s).
- Based on your models and the table of data, recommend some general locations to the business owner, taking into account model performance. Validate your model's performance and ability to predict future sales using cross-validation.
- Bonus: Recommend targets for volume sold and price per bottle!
